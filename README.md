# Project: Modeling COVID19 for policy analysis

The  Corona  virus  pandemic  was  the  biggest  event  globally  this  year.  Many  people  got  sick  with  minorsymptoms,  some  ended  up  in  the  intensive  care  units  (ICUs),  and  some  portion  of  those  infected  died. It  affected  every  aspect  of  everyone’s  life:  national  borders  closed,  flights  were  suspended,  schools  closed, working  from  home  was  instituted,  social  distancing  measures  were  put  in  place,  in  some  countries  facemasks  were  required,  and  washing  your  hands  often  became  a  necessity.  Why  did  the  government  adoptthese measures? Did we do these things to protect ourselves? Or to protect the others? Why? How?

Recall all the information you received during the outbreak: news clips, infographs you saw in the newspapers, pictures, etc. Draw a Concept Mapof how Corona virus spread, and  what are believed to be effective preventive measures?

Among the information you received, try to identify one or few simple mathematical model(s) that were used to predict the outbreak and the effectiveness of the interventions. Try to explain those models. What do you think were used to make the predictions? What were the  input variables? What were the output variables? What was the relationship or the equations in those models? Do you think they were good models (How do you determine if a model is “good”)? What do you think they missed? What do you think can be improved? Which information do you think was missing?

Compare  your  concept  map  with  the  observations  you  made  in  Walk  and  talk  II:  The  places  COVID-19 touched. Were your observation consistent with the “best” advise you would have given if you were the expert after studying these models?

In a group of 4, make a pecha-kucha presentation (a slide show with 20 slides where each slide stays forexactly 20 second) that includes at least the following:

• a Concept Map of how corona virus spread and possible interventions;

• present a mathematical model(s)that can make a prediction of the outbreak and a critique of themodel(s) based on what you learn in the other classes, such as Evolution i biologiska system, Linj ̈aralgebra och experimentell matematik, etc.;

• compare the knowledge you learn from the model and the experience you had in Walk and talk II: Theplaces COVID-19 touched, point out the gaps and inconsistencies and reflect on why the gaps existand what can be done about them?

• Upload  your  model  to  Github  or  any  website  that  supports  Open  Model/Open  Code/Open  source.Make sure that the model is easily to assess and fully documented. Download a model developed bythe other team from this class. Run their model and compare with your results.
